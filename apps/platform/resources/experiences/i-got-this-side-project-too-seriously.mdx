I was just another tech enthusiast student who thought I can build enterprise software just after building my first react app. Also, a college senior of mine suggested I should start applying for internships now after seeing my work,
Not boasting but I had a decent GitHub profile with some projects. One of them was a real world project I built in 24 hours alone with react and node.js (for web scraping). It was project inspired of a senior's project and I just wanted to build something like that.
So, I build that one result ranking web app, Although it was just a side project, I took it too seriously and ended up spending more than 6 months on it.
