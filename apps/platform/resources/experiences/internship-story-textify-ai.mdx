In Dec 2022, I started my **3-month SDE internship** at Textify.ai although it ended up being 1.5 years. This was my first fully remote role, and I learned a lot about working independently while still being part of a team.

### How I Got the Internship
I was just another tech enthusiast sophomore student who thought I can build enterprise software just after building my first react app. Also, a college senior of mine suggested I should start applying for internships now after seeing my work,
Not boasting but I had a decent GitHub profile with some projects at that time. One of them was a real world project I built in 24 hours (initial version) alone check it out [here](https://app.nith.eu.org).
It was a project inspired by a senior's project and I just wanted to build something like that.

So, I started applying on various site like [Internshala](https://internshala.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), and [AngelList](https://wellfound.com). 
I applied to [Textify.ai](https://textify.ai) after seeing their job post on [AngelList](https://wellfound.com). After resume shortlisting and a live coding technical interviews, I got the offer.

### What I Worked On
In the beginning, I was assigned a React project as Textify was a new startup with no existing codebase.
It was idea execution phase where the primary focus was on building a set of AI tools based on AI use-cases it was that time when ChatGPT was launched and AI was the buzzword. 
I was one of the first few engineers, and I had the opportunity to shape the product from the ground up but as the application grew Every app cases was hard-code there So,
I came up with a solution to make it dynamic and configurable. I built a **no-code interface** that allowed users to create custom AI tools without needing code changes just by 
drag and drop and adding variables for the AI tool. This was a game-changer for the product, allowing non-technical users to create their own AI tools.

We also shifted to Nextjs for the frontend, which improved performance and SEO. While everything was going well, **Authentication** was a challenge at that time as our primary goal was to build feature and not stuck up in authentication.
I implemented **AWS Cognito** for user authentication, which provided a secure and scalable solution. This was my first experience with AWS services, and I learned a lot about managing user identities and permissions.
But as the product evolved, we ended up with couples our backend with AWS and duplicated users data in multiple places. So, without delaying essential features, we had to find a way to streamline our architecture.
So, I proposed a solution to use **Next Auth** for authentication, which allowed us to decouple the frontend and backend authentication logic. This made it easier to manage user sessions and provided a more flexible solution for our growing needs.
which also allowed us to integrate with various identity providers like Google, GitHub, and email/password authentication and _share session across multiple sub-domains applications_
about which I wrote a  [blog post here](https://medium.com/@kanakkholwal/how-to-implement-authentication-across-all-subdomains-using-next-auth-in-next-js-2ad8393c268d).

While application was growing, existing free tier of AWS was not enough for us to scale up and without investing setting up proper pipeline for CI/CD, we were facing issues with deployments.
So, I set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions and Azure Web Apps**, which automated our deployment process and allowed us to deploy changes quickly and reliably. This was my first experience with CI/CD, and it taught me the importance of automation in software development.
Which later on we moved to **GCP** for hosting our application and used **Cloud Run** and **Docker** for deploying our Next.js application, which provided a serverless solution that scaled automatically based on traffic.

These experiences taught me a lot about building scalable applications, managing user authentication, and deploying applications in the cloud.

### ⚙️ Key Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Zustand, TypeScript, SWR
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito, Next Auth
- **Deployment**: Docker, Azure Web Apps, GCP Cloud Run and GCP Cloud Build & Google Artifact Registry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Challenges I Faced
- **Remote Work**: Adapting to a fully remote environment was challenging initially. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and communicate clearly with my team.
- **System Design**: Designing scalable systems from scratch was a new experience. I had to think about architecture, performance, and user experience.
- **Debugging**: Debugging large-scale applications with multiple services was complex. I learned to use tools like Redis for caching and performance optimization.
- **Collaboration**: Working with a distributed team required clear communication and collaboration tools. We used Slack, GitHub, and Zoom for daily stand-ups and code reviews.

### Key Takeaways
- **Independence**: Remote internships teach you to be self-reliant and proactive in seeking help.
- **Learning Curve**: You will face challenges, but they are opportunities to learn and grow
- **Networking**: Building relationships with colleagues is crucial, even in a remote setting.
- **Real-world Experience**: Working on a live product gives you insights into the full software development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment.
- **System Design**: You will gain hands-on experience in designing scalable systems and understanding cloud architecture.


### What I Gained
- **Hands-on experience** with Next.js, AWS, and cloud deployments
- **Understanding of system design** and architecture
- **Skills in building scalable applications** and managing user authentication
- **Experience with CI/CD pipelines** and automated deployments
- **Collaboration in a remote team** environment
- **Real-world system design**
- Exposure to full product lifecycle
- Confidence in debugging large-scale apps

### Conclusion
My internship at Textify.ai was a transformative experience that taught me valuable skills in software development,
cloud computing, and remote work. I had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and contribute to a product that is making a difference in the AI space.
