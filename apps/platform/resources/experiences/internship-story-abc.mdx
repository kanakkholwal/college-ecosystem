In Jan 2023, I started my **6-month SDE internship** at Textify.ai. It was fully remote and intense, but incredibly rewarding.

### What I Worked On

- Built secure login using **AWS Cognito** and `NextAuth`
- Led development of **low-code modular UI**
- Integrated **OpenAI & Google LLaMA** for AI features
- Used **Docker + CI/CD** pipelines for production releases

### Challenges I Faced

- Understanding AWS Cognito deeply took time
- Coordinating across time zones
- Balancing frontend/backend coordination

> ⚙️ Tools Used: Next.js, AWS, Azure, GCP, Redis, Tailwind, Docker

### What I Gained

- **Real-world system design**
- Exposure to full product lifecycle
- Confidence in debugging large-scale apps

**Takeaway**: Remote internships teach independence. Keep learning and building!
